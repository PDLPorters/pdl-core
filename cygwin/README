=================================================================
                            Overview
=================================================================
This directory contains supplemental build information to
configure and install PDLA on a windows system with the cygwin
toolset (http://www.cygwin.com).

The cygwin library provides the missing unix/posix functionality
to allow unix applications to be more easily ported to windows.
A windows PC with cygwin looks like different flavor of unix.
Since cygwin looks like a unix, [almost] all of the standard
perl functionality works and PDLA can build pretty much as it
does on other unix systems.

See the INSTALL file for instructions on building and
installing PDLA on cygwin and for notes on building the external
dependencies.

See the PDLA/win32 subdirectory for instructions on building a
native windows PDLA.



=================================================================
                             WORKING
=================================================================
The cygwin PDLA includes all the base PDLA functionality          
including bad values support (if configured) as well as the     
following modules which depend on the presence of various       
external dependencies:                                          

 PDLA::FFTW
  (Builds if FFTW version 2 has been hand built and installed,
   cygwin Setup.exe only provides FFTW version 3).

 PDLA::Graphics::PGPLOT
  (Builds if the FORTRAN pgplot library has been hand built
   and installed, and if the *Perl* PGPLOT module is installed
   and FORTRAN)

 PDLA::Graphics::TriD
  (Builds automatically if you have X11 and OpenGL + FreeGLUT
   installed).

 PDLA::GSL::*
 PDLA::GSLSF::*
  (Builds if GSL is installed via cygwin Setup.exe)

 PDLA::IO::GD
  (Builds if the gd lib is installed via cygwin Setup.exe)

 PDLA::GIS::Proj
 PDLA::Transform::Proj4
  (Builds if the PROJ4 lib is installed via cygwin Setup.exe)

 PDLA::Minuit
  (Builds if ExtUtils::F77 has been installed and FORTRAN)

 PDLA::Slatec
  (Builds if ExtUtils::F77 has been installed.
   Needs a FORTRAN compiler.)

 PDLA::IO::Browser
  (Build may pass if enabled, disabled by default for all OSes)
 
 pdl2
  (Installed by default.  To use the new features, you
   will need to install Devel::REPL and one of either
   Term::ReadLine::Perl or Term::ReadLine::Gnu.  The Gnu
   flavor is currently recommended for cygwin.)

and also

 PDLA::ParallelCPU
  (Parallel pthread support will build and install by default
   since the cygwin DLL includes POSIX threads)



=================================================================
               GRAPHICS (non-CORE DISTRIBUTION)
=================================================================
These graphics modules are known to work but are not in the
core PDLA distribution.  You'll need to install from CPAN
separately:

 PDLA::Graphics::Gnuplot  Needs the gnuplot executable
  
 PDLA::Graphics::Prima    Install Prima and PDLA::Graphics::Prima
                         via the cpan shells cpan, cpanm...
			 Give interactive plotting support and
			 a full GUI toolkit that can be used to
			 implement graphical perl/PDLA/Prima apps.



=================================================================
                           NOT WORKING
=================================================================
These modules with external dependencies are not yet available
for cygwin:

 PDLA::Graphics::IIS

 PDLA::IO::HDF           (HDF4 has not been ported to cygwin
                         but HDF5 is available via the cygwin
			 setup program.  PDLA::IO::HDF5 fails
			 to build due to unix/linux specific
			 library detection for libhdf5)
  
 PDLA::IO::NDF           (NDF has not been ported to cygwin)
